# StringToComponent
takes input as a string from a class property and matches it to a component then renders component as a function to be executed = REACT 


this is part od a pacman style gave i am working on and here i am renderering "block" to the page that were created randomly by the program. 
I needed a way to take the title of the component and use it to render the component function with the same name/title

rough code but just wanted to throw it up..
